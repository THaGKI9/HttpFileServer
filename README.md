## Thanks to :http://blog.xiaket.org/2011/extending-simplehttpserver.html

This is a file server base on SimpleHTTPServer.
But it's quiet different because:
* Header 'Range' supported
* Multi threads supported

With the support of Range-Header, I can directly use my iPhone to watch the videos in my PC(Ahahahah, that's why i code it.)
Next following features will be added when the new version comes:
* Upload
* Entire disk sharing
